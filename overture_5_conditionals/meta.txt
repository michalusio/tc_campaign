When the two largest bits are [ON][ON], we are in condition mode. In condition mode, the value in REG 3 is compared against the conditions defined by the lowest 3 bits in the instruction. If the condition is true, we overwrite the counter to the value in REG 0.
Conditionally changing the counter means we can skip [INSTRUCTIONS] based on conditions or have [INSTRUCTIONS] run in a loop.

Conditions:
[OFF] [OFF] [OFF] Never
[OFF] [OFF] [ON] Always
[OFF] [ON] [OFF] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] = 0
[OFF] [ON] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] ≠ 0 
[ON] [OFF] [OFF] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] < 0
[ON] [OFF] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] ≥ 0

[ON] [ON] [ON] If [color=#e49f44]REG 3[/color] > 0

These conditions correspond to the condition component that was saved in the component factory.`),
