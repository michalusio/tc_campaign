  (alien, `It is time to remove the Fast RAM component from your circuit, its gate score is just too high.

We will replace it with a Latency RAM, this ram is cheap in terms of both gates and delay, but it takes multiple ticks to complete.`),
  (alien, `Just as with the data hazard level, the goal of this level is to test if we can safely execute instructions. 

If the input instruction is a RAM instruction, we consider the RAM busy until we see the RAM ready signal.

While RAM is busy with a store, we can only execute ALU and IO instructions.
While RAM is busy with a load, we cannot execute anything. 

We don't execute anything while waiting for load to keep the architecture less complicated for now. Load instructions overwrite a register, so we would have to check that we didn't use thar register before it was loaded. Also, the result of a load needs a register store, so we would need to make sure one of the pipelines were free.`),
